# Morning Exercise

1. Create 4 variables named `eleven`, `twentyTwo`, `thirtyThree`, `fortyFour`. Set them equal to `11`, `22`, `33`, and `44` respectively.

2. Store the values of the variables in an array named `numbers` from largest to smallest.

3. Loop thru the array and display each number in the console from smallest to largest.

4. Loop thru the array again. This time if the number is even then log the statement `"The number [number] is even!"`. If the number is odd then display `"The number [number] is odd!"`

_Note: **[number]** indicates the value of the element you are looping thru._
