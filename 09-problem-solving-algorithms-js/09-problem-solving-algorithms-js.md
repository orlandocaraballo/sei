# Problem Solving

## Why is Problem Solving important to Developers?

_Problem solving allows us to take a very complex problem and break it down so that mere mortals can understand_

## Orlando's Alchemic Problem Solving Process

<img src="alchemy.gif" width="100%" />

1. __Reduce the problem down to simpler problems__
    - If the problem is still too complex, break it down again
    - If the problem is solvable then solve that problem
2. __Understand how the smaller problems fit with the larger problem__
    - Understand your end goal (what am I trying to accomplish?)
    - How can I glue my simpler solutions into a large one?
3. __Use this knowledge to create a solution__
    - Using your knowledge of the first two steps, create a solution that binds the smaller solutions together

## Is this is a serious process?

_Yes, yes it is. I use it myself :-D_

## Simple Problem

_I have a hole in my pocket but I don't know how to sew. How do fix the hole in my pocket?_

## Complex Problem

_I am looking to switch careers. I am currently unhappy at my job. I feel demotivated, confused and lost in my life. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about this but we have been growing apart over time. I don't know what do. What should I do?_

## How Does This Apply to Code

Much like the problem above, solving code challenges can have multiple solutions. Keep the end goal in mind and the steps to get there start to matter less. This also happens to be a metaphor for life. __Let that sink in__...

## Strategy for Solving Code Problems

1. Identify the end goal (output)
    - _What am I trying to do?_
2. Identify the information you have available (input)
    - _What are my options here?_
3. Identify the tools you have at your disposal
    - _What functions can I use?_
4. Identify if your blocks
    - _Should I look to strengthen my knowledge of closures?_
    - _Am I missing some information?_
5. Formulate your strategy
    - _How am I going to approach this?_
    - _Will I use arrays, objects or functions?_
    - _What variables or objects should I be creating?_
6. Execute your strategy
    - _Ok I know what I need to do, now all I need is to code the solution_

__Note: If you have not at least thought through the steps 1 - 5 above, do not start coding. You may think you are making progress, but you may just be spinning your wheels__

## _¿What are some of your approaches for solving problems?_

---

## Problem

_You are really hungry today so you decide to head to the grocery store to buy some supplies to cook some food for yourself. You managed to quickly scrounge together a grocery list to use for keeping yourself focused on buying only what you have written down. There are 15 aisles in the grovery store. In words, how would you go about searching for your groceries?_

## Psuedocode

_Psuedocoding is the process of solving a coding problem in words and then converting this code into actual language code_

## Problem

_How can we convert the prior psuedocode into actual code?_

## Coding Problem Dos

- __Code in small snippets and verify it works every step of the way__
  - You will build confidence in your own abilities
- __If you are frustrated, take a 5-10 minute break__
  - Those 5-10 minutes now can give you the much needed space to activate your creative right brain
- __If you have completed your work, try helping others__
  - Teaching others will help you understand what you are doing much better
- __Use google as a resource for understanding__
  - It may seem tempting to just search the solution but you may miss out on the smaller lessons in between
  - Try to do you it yourself before consulting google
- __Write down your logic on paper before coding__
  - This helps for larger problems
- __Again, remember to relax.. it's going to be ok__
  - If you are stressed, you will not be able to think clearly

## Coding Problem Don'ts

- __Don't immediately start trying random things without identifying your strategy__
  - This will stress you out
- __Don't just seek the answer on google__
- __Don't go down the rabbit hole__ 

## Algorithms

### What is an algorithm?

_A set of steps that can be used to solve a problem_

### Problem

_What algorithm would you use to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?_

### Algorithms in Life

- Finding the shortest path between several locations
- Identifying what activities take priority in your life
- Using these priorities to structure your day
- Searching through a dictionary for a word
- Cooking
- Making a sandwich
- Cleaning your apt / house

### Algorithms in Code

#### Bubble Sort

_The __bubble sort__ algorithm makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place. __In essence, each item “bubbles” up to the location where it belongs.__ This process will take multiple iterations._

- __Worst-case performance__:	О(n2)
- __Best-case performance__:	O(n)
- __Average performance__:	О(n2)

#### Insertion sort

_**Insertion sort** is a simplistic sorting algorithm that sorts one element at a time. Most humans, when sorting a deck of cards, will use a strategy similar to insertion sort. The algorithm takes an element from the list and places it in the correct location in the list. This process is repeated until there are no more unsorted items in the list._

- __Worst-case performance__:	О(n2)
- __Best-case performance__:	O(n)
- __Average performance__:	О(n2)

#### Linear search

_**Linear search**, also known as sequential search, is a process that checks every element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found._

- __Worst-case performance__:	О(n)
- __Best-case performance__:	O(1)
- __Average performance__:	О(n)

#### Binary search

_**A binary search** locates an item in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The initial interval includes the entire array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, then the next interval will be the lower half of the current interval. If the value of the search key is greater than the middle item, then the next interval will be the upper half. The search process repeats until the item is found or the search interval is empty._

- __Worst-case performance__:	O(log n)
- __Best-case performance__:	O(1)
- __Average performance__:	O(log n)
