# Introduction to Data Structures using Javascript

## Definition

_A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data_

## Why Use Objects

_Objects provide us with a lot of power in how we organize our information because we are developers can decide the structure and behavior of code that is related together_

## Caveats

- Objects can be more work initially because you have group your code into constraints and classification hierarchies
- Object oriented design can get complicated

## Examples

- Object literal (sometimes seen as hashes in other languages)
- Object
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Linked List
- Blockchain

## Exercises

1. Which data structure would you use to store english words and their translations to two other languages such as Spanish and French?
    - Given the following words: chair, television, lamp, music and window. What would the code look like to store this information and its translations?
    - How would you loop through this data structure?
2. Which data structure would you use when organizing a hierarchy of species of animals?
2. Which data structure would you use when storing books you have read?
    - How would you write the code for that?
    - How would you loop through this data structure?
3. Which data structure would you use when storing all information regarding a truck?
    - What if you had to store information on multiple trucks, which data structure would you use here?
    - Would this data structure work if you wanted the truck or trucks to move? Why?
    - Create a data structure that would house the following information:
      - Truck A:
        - Wheels: 8
        - Miles per gallon: 5.5 mpg
        - Top speed: 50 mph
      - Truck B:
        - Wheels: 4
        - Miles per gallon: 16 mpg
        - Top speed: 60 mph
      - Truck C:
        - Wheels: 18
        - Miles per gallon: 5.9 mpg
        - Top speed: 45 mph

      __All trucks should be able to move forward and backward__
